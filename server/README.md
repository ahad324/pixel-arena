# ‚öôÔ∏è Pixel Arena - Server

This directory contains the backend server for the Pixel Arena application. It is built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, and it uses Socket.IO to manage all real-time, stateful multiplayer game logic.

## ‚ú® Core Functionality

- **WebSocket Handling:** Manages all real-time communication via a structured Socket.IO event system.
- **State Management:** The `GameService` class holds the in-memory state of all active rooms, players, and game sessions.
- **Modular Game Logic:** Each game mode's logic is encapsulated in its own module, making it easy to maintain and extend.
- **Room Management:** Handles the creation, joining, and automatic cleanup of game rooms.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Utilizes worker threads for heavy computations like maze generation to prevent blocking the main thread.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Framework:** [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Communication:** [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)
- **Development:** [ts-node-dev](https://github.com/wclr/ts-node-dev) for live-reloading.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

The `src/` directory is organized for modularity and separation of concerns:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/         # Game constants and settings (e.g., grid size, game timers)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/       # Core logic services, primarily `gameService` (the game engine)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sockets/        # Socket.IO event listeners and emitters, connecting client actions to game logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/          # Shared TypeScript type definitions for the server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/          # Utility functions (e.g., maze generation and worker pool)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.ts          # Express app configuration (CORS, basic routes)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts        # Server entry point, initializes the HTTP server and Socket.IO instance
```

## üì° WebSocket API

The server communicates with clients through a defined set of Socket.IO events.

## üìú Available Scripts

From within the `server/` directory, you can run the following commands:

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the server in development mode using `ts-node-dev` for automatic restarts on file changes.
- **`npm run build`**: Compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript in the `/dist` directory.
- **`npm run start`**: Runs the compiled JavaScript application from the `/dist` directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

The server requires a `.env` file for configuration. Create one by copying the example:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

**`server/.env`**

```env
# The port the server will run on
PORT=3000

# The URL of the frontend client, required for CORS configuration
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```
